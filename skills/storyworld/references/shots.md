# The shot method, in detail

Storyworld has specialists (the director, cinematographer, script supervisor,
casting and others) that know the project, its World and the craft standards
for each part of a shot. You consult them before you write, the server records
that you did, and after the write they check the result. A shot written
without consulting is refused, so this is not optional; done well, it is also
what makes shots cut together.

## Before the first shot

1. **Story form.** `studio_read (type: project_get)` and read `form`. If it is
   empty, ask the person whether this is a feature film, an episode, a short or
   an ad, then save it as `fields.form` with
   `project_write (type: project_update)`. Some checks stay blocked until the
   form is known, so do this first rather than after a failed check.
2. **The sequence.** Find or create it (`sequence_read (type: seq_sequences_list)`,
   `sequence_write (type: seq_sequence_create)`). While it has no shots, call
   `engine (type: engine_consult)` with domain video, concept sequence and the
   sequence's id. Its relationships tell you how the characters in this scene
   stand toward each other, which shapes how the scene opens.

## Each shot

1. **Create it bare.** `seq_shot_create` with the shot number you choose and
   one line of intent: what the shot is for ("Mara realises the key is gone"),
   not what it looks like. A shot is addressed afterwards by its sequence and
   number; its id for the specialists is `<sequenceId>-<n>`.
2. **See who must be consulted.** `engine (type: engine_inspect)` with domain
   video, concept shot and the shot's id names the roles an update needs
   evidence from, and any check blocked on the story form.
3. **Consult once per part you will write.** Call `engine (type: engine_consult)`
   with domain video, concept shot, the shot's id and a focus. Shot focuses
   are material, camera, action, direction, background, negative,
   animation-preview, storyboard, physics, light, look, format and continuity.
   Only consult the focuses you are about to write. On the second and later
   consults, send `held` with the versions earlier replies named, so the
   server does not repeat what you already have.
4. **Read the relationships before the beats.** The action and direction
   consults carry how the characters in frame stand toward each other. Play
   that in what each one does and says. Never write the relationship itself
   into the shot ("his rival"); show it ("he doesn't offer his hand").
5. **Write once, with everything.** `seq_shot_update` with the shot's current
   `rev`, only the fields you change, and every consult's `evidenceId` in
   `evidenceIds`. If the update is refused for consultation evidence, the
   refusal names the roles still missing: consult those and send again.
6. **Judge it yourself.** Read your write against the standards the consults
   gave. The server checks structure and rules; it does not decide whether the
   shot is good. That is your job, and in the end the person's.
7. **Check it.** `engine (type: engine_check)` on the shot with `waitMs` 10000.
   If the answer still lists pending checks, call again: empty findings with
   pending checks is not a clean result.
8. **Answer every finding.** Either fix it with another `seq_shot_update`
   (passing the check's `evidenceId` as `exposureId`), or dismiss it with
   `findings (type: story_finding_dismiss)` and a real reason the person
   would accept. "Not important" is not a reason.

## Craft notes that save rework

- **Length comes from the beats.** A shot has no duration field; it lasts as
  long as its beats add up to, and that must fit the video model it will run
  on. `sequence_read (type: storyboard_context_get)` shows the length the
  beats come to.
- **Dialogue lives in the beat it is spoken in**, with who says it and how.
- **Name assets with `@`** (`@Mara`) in any prose, and only after the asset is
  in the shot's assets list. Characters, places and props are referenced by
  asset id in `assets`, never by typing a name.
- **Continuity carries forward.** What a body or prop carries out of a shot
  (torn sleeve, wet hair, the key in her left hand) goes in the shot's
  continuity, spelled as the asset is named, so the next shot opens on it.
- **Light a sequence once**, on the sequence. A shot writes its own lighting
  only where it differs.
- **Before generating**, `preview (type: seq_shot_compile)` shows the prompt
  Storyworld will send and whether anything blocks it. Show the person the
  plan in plain words if they want to review it before spending.

## Working on many shots

Direct shots in order, one at a time: consult, write, check, answer findings,
then move on. A later shot's continuity reads the earlier one's end state, so
batching all the writes first and checking later produces drift you then have
to unwind. Keep the person posted in a line per shot ("Shot 3 written; the
cinematographer flagged the lens, fixed"), not a wall of JSON.
